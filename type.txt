Google Drive is considered Software as a Service (SaaS) because it is a cloud-based service that allows users to store, share, and access files and documents 
over the internet. Users can access their files and documents from any device with an internet connection and do not need to install any software on their device. 
The service is managed and maintained by Google, and users typically pay a subscription fee to access the service. This subscription-based model and the fact that 
it is delivered over the internet are key characteristics of SaaS.
